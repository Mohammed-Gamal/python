    "Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a starting vertex to all other vertices in a weighted undirected connected graph with non-negative edge weights, otherwise, if negative weights are present, the Bellman-Ford algorithm should be used instead. It maintains a set of vertices whose shortest distance from the source is known and iteratively expands this set by selecting the vertex with the smallest known distance. The algorithm updates the distances of neighboring vertices and continues until all vertices have been processed."

    "- **Time Complexity:** $O(E \\cdot f^{*})$ in the worst case, where $E$ is the number of edges and $f^{*}$ is the maximum flow value in the network. The time complexity can be improved to $O(V \\cdot E^2)$ using the Edmonds-Karp implementation (which uses BFS for finding augmenting paths).\n",

    "The **Ford-Fulkerson algorithm** computes the maximum flow in a flow network. It works by repeatedly finding augmenting paths from the source to the sink in the residual graph and increasing the flow along these paths until no more augmenting paths can be found. The algorithm maintains a residual capacity for each edge, which represents the remaining capacity available for additional flow. The process continues until no more augmenting paths exist, at which point the maximum flow is achieved."
